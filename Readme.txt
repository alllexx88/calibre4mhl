Calibre4mhl is a command-line tool that makes use of Calibre to convert fb2 ebooks to various formats within MyHomeLib.BUILDINGYou'll need mingw c++ compiler to build calibre4mhl. Get a fresh one from here:http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/If you installed it someplace different from C:\TDM-GCC-32, edit build.bat with a text editor and change line "set MINGW_BIN_DIR=C:\TDM-GCC-32\bin" accordingly.Launch build.bat, and it should compile calibre4mhl.exe.INSTALLINGFor using calibre4mhl, Calibre is nedded. Either install it, or unpack a portable version. Make sure you install/unpack it to a location that consists of ASCII symbols only; otherwise Calibre's command-line tools won't work.As for now, MyHomeLib user scripting feature is poorly developed, so it is required to install calibre4mhl in place of fb2mobi/fb2epub converters for it to work properly. First copy calibre4mhl.exe and config.txt to <MyHomeLib_dir>\converters\fb2mobi and/or <MyHomeLib_dir>\converters\fb2epub, and then rename calibre4mhl.exe to fb2mobi.exe or fb2epub.exe respectively.If you unpacked a portable Calibre version, you need to edit "config.txt" that you copied together with calibre4mhl binary and set "calibre_dir" to where your Calibre command-line binaries are: they should be in "<unpack_path>\Calibre Portable\Calibre". You can use either a relative, or an absolute path.You may leave "calibre_dir" blank if you installed a non-portable version.CONFIGURINGSee "config.txt" for further configuring calibre4mhl.USINGTo use calibre4mhl, simply save fb2 ebook(s) from your MyHomeLib collection in mobi and/or epub format, depending on where you installed it.
